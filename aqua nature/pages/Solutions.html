    <h2> Preservation </h2>
    <p> One of the easiest ways to protect animals in water is by creating technologies that can clean the water of dirt and debris. In this way we help animals and their way of life significantly.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Observation </h2>

    <p> Observations of animals in the water, especially endangered species, are of great importance, because only in this way can we know which animals are endangered and which are not. the oceans, which gives us access to know who is at risk and who is not. Also, technology often finds new species of animals in the water, making them even more important and useful. </p>
	
	
    <h2> Development </h2>

    <p> Nowadays, technology can both speed up and slow down the development of marine animals. In most cases, we want to accelerate their development so that they can grow faster, get bigger and heavier, and start selling for more and more money. Delays in the development of organisms are rarely used, but it is also something through which technology affects animals in the water.
