    <h2>In order for water resources to be well managed, water quality needs to be closely monitored.</h2>
    
    <p>The availability of good quality water is extremely important for people, nature and economic activities. Large amounts of water are needed to produce energy, food and goods for daily use. Restoring the natural state of waterways is very important so that fish, birds and animals can have the food and habitat they need.</p>

    <p>The good condition of the marine environment is also vital. Marine pollution is usually caused by land, but marine activities and the atmosphere can also be a source of pollution. </p>
